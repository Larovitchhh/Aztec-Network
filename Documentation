# Writing Smart Contracts for Aztec Network

Aztec uses [Noir](https://noir-lang.org), a domain-specific language for writing private smart contracts with zero-knowledge proofs. This tutorial introduces writing a simple Aztec contract.

## Example: Private Counter Contract
Below is a sample contract that maintains a private counter, incrementable only by the owner.

```noir
contract PrivateCounter {
    private state counter: Field;
    private state owner: AztecAddress;

    fn initialize(initial_value: Field, owner: AztecAddress) {
        counter = initial_value;
        owner = owner;
    }

    fn increment() {
        assert(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can increment");
        counter = counter + 1;
    }
}
