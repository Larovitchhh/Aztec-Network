# Aztec Protocol Whitepaper Summary

The Aztec Protocol is a zero-knowledge privacy protocol for Ethereum, enabling confidential transactions. Key concepts include:

- **AZTEC Notes**: Encrypted representations of value (e.g., ERC-20 tokens) with an owner defined by an Ethereum address.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Used to validate transactions without revealing amounts, via homomorphic encryption and range proofs.
- **ACE (Aztec Cryptography Engine)**: A smart contract that validates zero-knowledge proofs, allowing customizable and interoperable assets.
- **Confidential Transactions**: Supports privacy for existing Ethereum assets, e.g., zkDai.

For the full whitepaper, see [Aztec Documentation](https://docs.aztecprotocol.com).
